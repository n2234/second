<ol id="l3"><li value="1"><b>History of civil engineering education</b>
The first private college to teach civil engineering in the United States was Norwich University, founded in 1819 by Captain Alden Partridge.[9] The first degree in civil engineering in the United States was awarded by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 1835.[10][11] The first such degree to be awarded to a woman was granted by Cornell University to Nora Stanton Blatch in 1905.[12]

In the UK during the early 19th century, the division between civil engineering and military engineering (served by the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich), coupled with the demands of the Industrial Revolution, spawned new engineering education initiatives: the Royal Polytechnic Institution was founded in 1838, the private College for Civil Engineers in Putney was established in 1839, and the UK's first Chair of Engineering was established at the University of Glasgow in 1840.</li>
